# AI Intuition Lab

A hands-on interactive guide to understanding how AI and Large Language Models work.

## About

AI Intuition Lab is an interactive educational resource designed to help people develop intuition for how modern AI and large language models (LLMs) actually work. It covers 10 key topics:

1. **Tokenization** – How text gets broken into pieces the model can process
2. **Embedding Space** – How tokens become meaningful numbers
3. **Inference** – How models generate text step by step
4. **Neural Networks** – The computational building blocks
5. **Attention** – How models focus on relevant context
6. **Pre-Training** – How models learn from massive datasets
7. **Fine-Tuning** – How models are adapted for specific tasks
8. **Prompting** – How to communicate effectively with AI
9. **Images & Sound** – How AI handles multimodal content
10. **Limitations** – What AI can't do (yet)

## Who Is This For?

- **Instructors** looking for resources to help students understand AI and LLMs
- **Self-learners** wanting to understand the basics so they can use AI more effectively
- Anyone curious about what's actually happening "under the hood"

## Getting Started

AI Intuition Lab is a single HTML file with no dependencies. Just open it in a browser.
